<p>Adolescence is characterized by many hurdles: puberty, complex peer relationships and increasing expectations of independence lead to stress and growth. For individuals who have been exposed to threatening situations such as physical or sexual abuse, these new challenges can be overwhelming. In particular, they may find it difficult to interpret othersâ€™ intent and to determine an appropriate response in ambiguous and threatening social situations.
	<b>I am interested in what characteristics of threat exposure result in a myriad of social and emotional difficulties, the brain mechanisms behind effects, and what can be done to ameliorate future problems at the individual, family, and societal levels.</b> To address these questions, I have immersed myself in the worlds of measurement, statistics, neuroimaging, and clinical work.</p>

<p>I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology and a M.S. in Applied Statistics at Northwestern University under the guidance of Drs. <a href ="https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/who-we-are/faculty-experts/nusslock.html"> Robin Nusslock</a> and <a href ="https://statistics.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/noelle-samia.html">Noelle Samia</a> as <a href ="https://www.nsfgrfp.org"> NSF GRFP</a> fellow. I previously worked as a data analyst in the <a href ="https://www.med.upenn.edu/bbl/bbl_nbil.html"> Brain Behavior Laboratory</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, working for <a href ="https://www.med.upenn.edu/bbl/faculty-rcgur.html"> Dr. Ruben C. Gur</a>. I completed the double degree program at Oberlin College & Conservatory in 2018, majoring in psychology and flute performance.</p>
